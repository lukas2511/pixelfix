LCD Stuck Pixel "Fix" Thingie (Screensaver)
-------------------------------------------

[SEIZURE WARNING] FLASHING COLORS AND SHIT

I have a stuck pixel on my macbook, and I wrote this little screensaver to help "unstick" it.

It didn't work, but maybe it will for others, so I'm releasing the few lines of sourcecode...
