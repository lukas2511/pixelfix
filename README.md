# LCD Stuck Pixel "Fix" Thingies

[SEIZURE WARNING] FLASHING COLORS AND SHIT

I have a stuck pixel on my macbook, and I wrote these little tools to help "unstick" it.

 - mac_app opens a flashing window that can be moved and resized to sit on a stuck pixel
 - mac_screensaver flashes the whole screen, but as screensaver, so you can lock your mac over night while trying to fix the pixel

It didn't work, but maybe it will for others, so I'm releasing the few lines of sourcecode...
